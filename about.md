Hi, I'm Shih-Chin. This website contains my study notes about computer graphics and rendering. The source code on my [github](https://github.com/shihchinw) is developed in my spare time just for learning purposes and not related to the production project I've been working on at my day job.

I enjoy learning new things. I'm so lucky to live in this era, there are so many fantastic open courses on-line which make me appreciate the beauty of each subject.

Learning is an endless journey, I'm still excited about the new things I've learned everyday. I collected some links of wonderful learning resources on the navigation bar. Those are my favorite materials during my self-study process. Hope you would enjoy those learning materials too!
