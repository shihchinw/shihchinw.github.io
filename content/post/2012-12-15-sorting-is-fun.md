title: Sorting is FUN
---

Since few artist friends of mine want to learn about computer programming, thus we formed a small python learning group, we call it PyClub, in our office. Recently at our PyClub, I introduced some sorting algorithms by demonstrating with poker cards. It's especially fun for all of us to sort a deck of cards manually with quicksort algorithm, and we all felt the power of divide-and-conquer at that moment!

However, the pseudo codes are not easy for my artist friends to memorize the algorithms, so I tried to find some other resources about the visualization of sorting algorithms. The whole process is like treasure hunting and I really find several interesting stuffs I've never seen before.

### The Sound of Sorting
What does the sorting sound like!! This demo is so creative!

Here are other references of sorting algorithms:

* [Sorting Algorithm Animations](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/)
* [Sorting Algorithm Visualization](http://sortvis.org/index.html) (contains algorithm implementation with python)
