      <description>When I decided to be a guest lecturer at NCKU last year, I kept asking myself what is the most important thing I wish I&amp;rsquo;d learned in school. I carefully reviewed my current skill sets and found most of my skills were developed at work. Besides sharing knowledge about Computer Graphics, I think there is a more fundamental competency we need to develop in school, that is continuous learning.</description>

      <description>I was privileged to be a guest lecturer to give five lectures about Computer Graphics at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Taiwan. When I prepared the course materials, I deeply realized again that the best way to learn a topic is to teach someone else (especially to a person who never heard about Computer Graphics before). In order to avoid teaching wrong ideas, I had carefully reviewed what I known from ground up and derived each mathematical equation in the textbooks.</description>
