      <description>The goal of tool-making is to make users do certain works more efficiently. A functional tool with poor designed interface would not be fully utilized by users, because users aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to use that tool if the interaction makes them feel frustrated.
Developing is a Iterative Process Although there are a few principles about user interface design, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we can simply apply those principles and get our jobs done.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friend received some tools developed in PySide for Maya recently. He tried to copy the latest pre-built binaries of PySide into Maya&amp;rsquo;s site-packages but got an import error. Therefore, we have to build the PySide for Maya from the ground up and this post is about the entire building process we&amp;rsquo;ve been through. Hope this note might be helpful for people who want to use PySide in Maya. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, the PySide for Maya 2012 built by vc9 can be downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwFItFJF_4j3Wm1kMDVXcWIxbW8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, enjoy it!
