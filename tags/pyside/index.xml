A functional tool with poor designed interface would not be fully utilized by users, because users aren&amp;rsquo;t willing to use that tool if the interaction makes them feel frustrated.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building PySide for Maya 2012 on Windows</title><link>https://shihchinw.github.io/2012/05/building-pyside-for-maya-2012-on-windows.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2012 00:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shihchinw.github.io/2012/05/building-pyside-for-maya-2012-on-windows.html</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my friend received some tools developed in PySide for Maya recently. He tried to copy the latest pre-built binaries of PySide into Maya&amp;rsquo;s site-packages but got an import error. Therefore, we have to build the PySide for Maya from the ground up and this post is about the entire building process we&amp;rsquo;ve been through. Hope this note might be helpful for people who want to use PySide in Maya. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BTW, the PySide for Maya 2012 built by vc9 can be downloaded &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwFItFJF_4j3Wm1kMDVXcWIxbW8">here&lt;/a>, enjoy it!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
