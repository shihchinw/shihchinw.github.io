Recently at our PyClub, I introduced some sorting algorithms by demonstrating with poker cards. It&amp;rsquo;s especially fun for all of us to sort a deck of cards manually with quicksort algorithm, and we all felt the power of divide-and-conquer at that moment!
However, the pseudo codes are not easy for my artist friends to memorize the algorithms, so I tried to find some other resources about the visualization of sorting algorithms.</description></item></channel></rss>
