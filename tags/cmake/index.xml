      <description>Alembic is a popular data format for geometry cache nowadays, however, there are no simple workflow to build the AbcImport/AbcExport on windows. In this post, I tried to demonstrate a building flow as simple as possible.
Here is the pre-built binaries for Maya 2013 x64.
Prerequisites  Boost  open vc10 command prompt cd c:\boost\boost_1_xx_00 bootstrap.bat b2 toolset=msvc-10.0 address-model=64 link=static threading=multi &amp;ndash;with-program_options &amp;ndash;with-thread  HDF5 Ilmbase Zlib glut (optional)  Since I usually build maya plugin with /MD, thus all the static third-party libraries I used are built with /MD.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friend received some tools developed in PySide for Maya recently. He tried to copy the latest pre-built binaries of PySide into Maya&amp;rsquo;s site-packages but got an import error. Therefore, we have to build the PySide for Maya from the ground up and this post is about the entire building process we&amp;rsquo;ve been through. Hope this note might be helpful for people who want to use PySide in Maya. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, the PySide for Maya 2012 built by vc9 can be downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BwFItFJF_4j3Wm1kMDVXcWIxbW8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, enjoy it!
